# sober #

Pelican-sober is a very light theme focused on readability :

* Integration of [TinyTypo](http://tinytypo.tetue.net)
* Utilisation of the font Source Sans Pro
* Option to fade out sidebar to focus on article reading

This theme provides also classical features like Google Analytics, Twitter, Disqus and Pygments integration.

## Twitter cards ##

[Twitter card metadata](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card) are useful to provides a better overview of your post
when a tweet point to it.

If you provide one of the two settings below, twitter card metadata will be automatically added for each post.

* ``PELICAN_SOBER_TWITTER_CARD_CREATOR = '__fle__' `` (author twitter account)
* ``PELICAN_SOBER_TWITTER_CARD_SITE = '__company__' `` (website/company twitter account)
